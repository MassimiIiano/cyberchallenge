# MineCClicker

Play with the best game in town and win if you dare! :)

## Notes

- See requirements.txt for the client's Python requirements.
- Run the client on your machine with `python3 game.py` to connect to the server and play.
- You can set remote host and port by specifying them as environment variables while running the client: `HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=9999 python3 game.py`.
- The client is provided to play with a GUI but *you don't have to search for vulnerabilities in there*.
